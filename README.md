## üß† Insights & Recommendations

Based on the SQL analysis, here are some key insights:

- **Office Supplies** generated the highest sales, but **Furniture** yielded higher profit margins.
- **Western and Northern regions** performed better in terms of sales, while **South-East** lagged behind.
- **High-priority orders** were sometimes shipped using slower or cheaper methods like *Delivery Truck*, which may affect customer satisfaction.
- **The top 10 customers** significantly contributed to overall revenue ‚Äî offering loyalty rewards could boost retention.
- **The bottom 10 customers** spent the least ‚Äî targeted marketing or bundle discounts may increase their order volume.
- **Appliances in Ontario** showed lower sales compared to other categories, indicating room for promotion or improved distribution.
- The most valuable customers typically ordered **high-volume office supplies** ‚Äî KMS can upsell related products to them.

These findings can help KMS optimize product focus, improve shipping logistics, and maximize revenue from both top and low-performing customer groups.
